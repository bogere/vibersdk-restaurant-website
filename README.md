## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
-   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aetheria-eatery.git
    cd aetheria-eatery
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` for package management.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Hono backend on Cloudflare Workers, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The project is structured into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application, including pages, components, stores, and hooks.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend application that runs on Cloudflare Workers.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and backend.

### Frontend

-   **Pages:** Located in `src/pages`, with `HomePage.tsx` being the main entry point.
-   **Components:** Reusable UI components are in `src/components`. Core UI elements are built using `shadcn/ui`.
-   **State Management:** Global state for the cart and filters is managed by Zustand stores in `src/store`.

### Backend

-   **API Routes:** Backend logic and API endpoints are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts` using the Hono framework.
-   **Data Persistence:** Data models (Entities) and interaction with Cloudflare Durable Objects are defined in `worker/entities.ts`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Build the project:**
    This command bundles the frontend and worker for production.
    ```bash
